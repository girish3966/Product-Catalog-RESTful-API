Project Name: Product Catalogue REST API

Project Overview:
This project implements a RESTful API for managing a structured product catalogue system. The API is developed using Java and integrated with a database, preferably MongoDB, to handle the storage of nested product data. Users can perform CRUD operations on products and search for products based on various filters.

Product Entity Structure:

id: Unique identifier for the product.
name: Name of the product.
description: Text description of the product.
price: Price of the product.
categories: Array of categories the product belongs to.
attributes: Array of key-value pairs for additional attributes.
availability: Object containing availability information.
ratings: Array of user ratings with user ID, rating value, and optional comment.

Database Integration:

    For MongoDB: Utilizes nested documents to store product data.
    For SQL: JSON data types or relational tables can be used to handle nested structures.

API Functionality:

    Endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting products.
    Endpoint for searching products with filters for name, category, and attributes.

API Documentation:

        URL: /products
        Method: POST
        Request Body: JSON
        Response: 200 OK or 400 Bad Request
    Get Product by ID:
        URL: /products/{id}
        Method: GET
        Response: 200 OK with product data or 404 Not Found
    Update Product:
        URL: /products/{id}
        Method: PUT
        Request Body: Same as "Add a Product" endpoint
        Response: 200 OK with updated product data or 404 Not Found

        Method: GET
        Query Parameters: name, category, attributes
        Response: 200 OK with array of matching products

Database Setup Instructions:

    For MongoDB: Install MongoDB, start server, create database and collection, configure URI in application properties.
    For SQL: Install SQL database server, design tables for nested structure, execute scripts to create tables and relationships.

Initial Data Seeding:

    Manually insert initial data using provided endpoints or create scripts for automation.

Project Hosting:

    Host on any server supporting Java applications (e.g., AWS, Heroku, local server).

Conclusion:
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the REST API project for a structured product catalogue system, including API endpoints, data model, database integration, setup instructions, and hosting options.
